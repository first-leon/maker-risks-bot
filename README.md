### Maker collaterals monitoring bot

Parse loans data from Maker protocol and calculate risks distribution 
based on collateral to loan ratio, see zones definition below.

#### Data sources

Vaults collected from [Maker Data API](https://data-api.makerdao.network).

Additional information about single vault collected via direct requests to ETH1 node.

#### Zones definition

Risk zones defined as a ranges of collateral to loan ration


| Zone        | >    | <    |
|-------------|------|------|
| A           | 2.50 | âˆž    |
| B+          | 1.75 | 2.50 |
| B           | 1.50 | 1.75 |
| B-          | 1.25 | 1.50 |
| C           | 1.10 | 1.25 |
| D           | 1.00 | 1.10 |
| Liquidation | 0    | 1.00 |
