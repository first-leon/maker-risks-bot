### Maker collaterals monitoring bot

Parse loans data from Maker protocol and calculate risks distribution 
based on collateral to loan ratio, see zones definition below.

#### Zones definition

| B+          | 1.75 | 2.50 |
| B           | 1.50 | 1.75 |
| B-          | 1.25 | 1.50 |
| C           | 1.10 | 1.25 |
| D           | 1.00 | 1.10 |
| Liquidation | 0    | 1.00 |

- `FLIPSIDE_ENDPOINT` is used to fetch indexed data from Flipside (subject to change)
- `EXPORTER_PORT` is the port to expose metrics on
